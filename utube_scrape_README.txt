The file utube_scrape.py is a program that was made for the purpose 
of taking data from the internet concerning a youtube channel. There 
is a set of youtube channels that are preset within this particular file,
but one can easily change this to any given youtube channel or it could even 
be changed to a user input prompt. The file takes whatever youtube channel
it is given and looks up and prints some data about it within terminal.
The HTML data is retrieved and parsed from the internet using Beautiful Soup whereby 
I look through it for the particular details I would like to know. In this
instance I was looking to list out a particular youtube channel's most popular videos,
the number of views each one has, the title of the video, and the URL for said videos.
